# TeleIn-Android
I have build an authentication system where user can login in the application(android) with the help of Telegram (Bot service). In this system , any user has not to go through any hassel. Any user just need to follow the steps to login the **TeleIn** app

1. Go to **TeleIn** app's login page
2. Click Login and it will redirect to **Telegram** app
3. Now in **Telegram** , just click start
4. The **_TeleIn Telegram Bot_** will provide a link
5. Click the link and you will be redirect to the **TeleIn**
6. By default it'll take your Telegram name, you can change it now and Submit.

That's it. Its too simple. No OTP no email comfirmation no extra auth flow! Just simple!
